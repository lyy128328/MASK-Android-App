# Chat.onion


## Anonymous and fully encrypted peer-to-peer instant messenger for Android using onion routing (via Tor)!

Many instant messengers already use encryption to secure message contents, but they can't hide important metadata such as your IP address and who you are communicating with!

To hide all your information, including your metadata, identity, and IP address, Chat.onion uses onion routing (Tor) to send each message over several randomly selected proxy servers. Multiple layers of encryption are used to ensure that each proxy only knows it's immediate successor and predecessor, but not the entire message route.

Chat.onion users are identified via 16 character checksums of their public keys. To connect with other users, send them an invitation with your ID, show them your QR code, or use your camera to scan theirs.
